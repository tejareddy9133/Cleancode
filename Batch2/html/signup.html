    Problem 1: Spread Operator with Arrays Write a function concatArrays that
    takes two arrays as arguments and uses the spread operator to concatenate
    them into a new array. For example: javascript Copy code
    console.log(concatArrays([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])); // Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
    6] Problem 2: Spread Operator with Objects Create a function mergeObjects
    that takes two objects as arguments and uses the spread operator to merge
    them into a new object. If there are any common keys, the values from the
    second object should overwrite the values from the first object. For
    example: javascript Copy code console.log(mergeObjects({ a: 1, b: 2 }, { b:
    3, c: 4 })); // Output: { a: 1, b: 3, c: 4 } Problem 3: Rest Operator with
    Function Parameters Write a function sumNumbers that uses the rest operator
    to accept any number of arguments and returns their sum. For example:
    javascript Copy code console.log(sumNumbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)); // Output: 15
    Problem 4: Rest Operator with Destructuring Create a function getFirstTwo
    that takes an array as an argument and uses the rest operator in combination
    with array destructuring to return the first two elements of the array. If
    the array has fewer than two elements, return an empty array. For example:
    javascript Copy code console.log(getFirstTwo([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Output: [1,
    2] console.log(getFirstTwo(['a'])); // Output: ['a']
