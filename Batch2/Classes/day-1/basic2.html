      Certainly, it's a great idea to explore online platforms for learning and
      updating your skills in new technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, Pug, and
      web analytics. Here's a sample email you can use to request support or
      resources from your HR department: Subject: Request for Professional
      Development Resources Dear [HR Manager's Name], I hope this email finds
      you well. As part of my ongoing commitment to delivering high-quality
      education to our students, I am excited to inform you that I will be
      incorporating new technologies, including Node.js, MongoDB, Pug, and web
      analytics, into my upcoming courses. To ensure I am well-prepared and able
      to provide the best learning experience, I am seeking access to online
      learning platforms such as Coursera, Udemy, or similar platforms that
      offer comprehensive courses in these technologies. These resources will
      not only enhance my understanding but will also enable me to stay current
      with industry best practices and emerging trends. I have identified
      several relevant courses on these platforms that align with our curriculum
      goals. However, I would appreciate your guidance on the best approach for
      accessing these resources, whether it be through institutional
      subscriptions, reimbursements, or any other means of support that our
      institute may offer for professional development. Here is a brief list of
      the courses I am considering: Node.js and Express.js - The Complete Guide
      (Udemy) MongoDB - The Complete Developer's Guide (Udemy) Pug: Template
      Engine for Node.js (Coursera) Web Analytics: From A to Z (Coursera) I
      believe that investing in these courses will not only enhance my teaching
      capabilities but will also contribute positively to the overall learning
      experience for our students. I would be grateful for any guidance or
      support you can provide in accessing these resources. If necessary, I am
      more than willing to discuss this further at your convenience. Thank you
      for your time and consideration. Sincerely, [Your Full Name] [Your
      Position] [Your Contact Information]
